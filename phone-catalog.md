# PHONE CATALOG

## The Challenge

The challenge is to create a **NextJS-based phone catalog app** from scratch. You'll be working with a modern tech stack similar to the one Sherpa uses, and the goal is to simulate the development process youâ€™d face in our team.

### Minimum Requirements

In broad terms, the outcome should meet at least the following criteria:

### 1. **Web App for Browsing the Phone Catalog**

- Built using **NextJS** and **TailwindCSS** for the frontend.
- The design should be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (desktop and mobile).
- The **Home page** should display a list of phones with images.
- Implement **server-side rendering (SSR)** for faster load times and better SEO.
- It should be possible to select a phone to view its details, which should include more information like manufacturer, price, and specifications.
- A **spinner or skeleton loader** should be shown while the REST API request is ongoing.

### 2. **REST API Providing Phone Information**

- Build the REST API using **Node.js** (preferably with **Prisma** for database management).
- The REST API should have at least one endpoint:

  - **Method:** GET
  - **Path:** `/phones`
  - **Response:** A JSON array containing phone details.

  Example response:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "iPhone 7",
      "manufacturer": "Apple",
      "description": "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.",
      "color": "black",
      "price": 769,
      "imageFileName": "IPhone_7.png",
      "screen": "4.7 inch IPS",
      "processor": "A10 Fusion",
      "ram": 2
    }
  ]
  ```

- Use a **PostgreSQL** database with Prisma for managing the data (you can use **Supabase** if hosting the database).

### 3. **GitHub Public Repository**

- The repository should store all code, with a clear directory structure.
- Include a `README.md` with:
  - A project description.
  - Instructions on how to run the project locally.
  - A list of technologies used (e.g., Next.js, Tailwind, Prisma, etc.).
  - Deployment instructions for both the API and the frontend.

### 4. **Basic DevOps and Deployment**

- Include a **CI/CD pipeline** (for example, using **GitHub Actions**).
- Optionally, Dockerize both the frontend and backend apps.

### Nice to Have

While the points above cover the basics, Sherpa encourages going beyond the core requirements to show your creativity and technical skills. Here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**

- Implement a simple authentication system (e.g., **NextAuth.js**, **JWT**, etc.) to protect certain features.
- Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete phones (basic CRUD operations).

### 2. **Additional Libraries and Tools**

- Feel free to integrate any useful libraries.

### 3. **Full CRUD Functionality**

- Extend the REST API to support **CRUD** operations:
  - **POST** for adding new phones.
  - **PUT** for updating existing phones.
  - **DELETE** for removing phones.
- The React app should include forms for creating and editing phones, with validation.

### 4. **Testing**

- Unit tests for React components.
- Integration tests for the REST API.
- End-to-end tests for the entire application.

### 5. **Persistence Layer**

- Store phone data using **Supabase** as a backend-as-a-service (with PostgreSQL) or a similar service.

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerts**

- Implement basic monitoring (e.g. **Betterstack**, **Sentry**, etc.) for error tracking.
- Set up basic alerting in case of downtime or errors.

### 7. **Deployment and Continuous Integration**

- Implement a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** or any other CI service.
- Set up automatic deployment on a service like **Vercel** or **Heroku** (or any other platform that supports NextJS).
